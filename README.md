# Compiler Project (PWN) - 2014/15 2nd Semester

**DISCLAIMER**

This project is incomplete, only reaching 50% or less of the required final tests for the course, but it does all the simple taks and global/local scope variable manipulation. Still, our grade was 11/20, and this repo just serves as some reference in Compiler Practice. So feel free to Fork the same and contribute if you wish, because I stopped working in this project after the evalution ended.
